# todo-app
This is  a mobx-reactjs based web-app that allows a user to add tasks to a todo list, mark them as completed and, delete todo's, search through available todo's, delete all that are marked complete all while displaying the total number of uncompleted tasks. 

You can access this app at https://todo-list-david-martin.netlify.com/ or at davidjmart.in

This project utilized react-mobx, and webpack installs for its creation.

To run on your own machine simply pull this repo, open the repo's directory and run npm start to run it on http://localhost:8080/

In order to make a build of this web-app simply run npm run build. If you want to make changes to build configurations you may need to change the organization and libraries of the repo as it was been setup to run and build through webpack. That is not to say it cannot be easily run by react, but it's important to know before diving into the package-lock.json and package.json rabbit holes.
